# ENSO-Phase-and-Tornado-Activity
Simple script that manipulates a preprocessed dataset in which ENSO phase data and United States tornado data are combined.
Tornado characteristics (freqeuncy, intensity, size, path length, nocturnal frequency, and freqency discrepancy) were analyzed and printed to look for trends/correlation between tornado activity and ENSO phase in different areas.
Our results show that tornadoes occur more frequently during the La Nina (cold) phase than the El Nino (warm) phase.
We also see that tornaodes during La Nina tend to be larger, longer lasting, and more frequent during nighttime hours.
Finally, we observe that southeastern states, especially Alabama, see a significant uptick in tornado activity during La Nina while coastal states such as Florida see an uptick in tornado activity during El Nino.
